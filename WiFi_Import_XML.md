This script imports saved wireless profile XML files. Currently the import folder is c:\user\public\desktop\wifi\ folder. 

It will loop and import each xml file in that folder.

I got the function and basis of the script from user "IT Apprentice" on Spiceworks at https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/133509-bulk-export-import-of-windows-wifi-profiles?page=2
