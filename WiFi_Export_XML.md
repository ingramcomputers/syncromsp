This will export all the saved wireless profiles to the public desktop folder. 

This makes it easy to backup. I always forget to backup a temp folder.

Each wireless profile will have its own xml file. So if you have 100 wifi networks saved, you will have 100 xml files.

To change the save location, just edit the script and change $dir variable.
